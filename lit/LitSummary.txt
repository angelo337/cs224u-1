2003_LDA.pdf. Original proposal of LDA by Andrew Ng.

2014_sematic_analysis.pdf published something to do text classification with wikipedia topics. We may treat this as our previous work.

2006_ESA.pdf and 2007_ESA.pdf are the papers on the method of ESA, which is used to extract topic information from wikipedia. It is used in  2014_sematic_analysis.pdf.

1992_brownCluster.pdf is something like ESA. It is compared with ESA in  2014_sematic_analysis.pdf.

2012_selectiveSearchDraft.pdf is a paper on image object detection. I think we can build a similar object detection method on text.

2000_James-Stein Estimator.pdf is not so useful. But it proposes a way of perciving the relations between labels in a heirarchical category structure.

2014_Young_ImageDescriptions.pdf. Mapping sentences to images using hypernyms, word vector similarity and composition of word vectors in sentences.

2012_Wang_Manning_Baselines_Bigrams.pdf. Various topic classification & sentiment analysis ideas & data sets.

2008_Sun_Text_Segmentation_LDA.pdf. An approach to extending LDA to segment a document into discrete topic sections.

2012_Huang_WordReps_GlobalContext_WordPrototypes.pdf. Vector space model comparable w/ GloVe, but also a potentially interesting contextual dataset.

hLDA_slides.pdf. A presentation slides that introduces hierarchical LDA.

2004_hLDA.pdf. A hierarchical LDA paper. Less useful. The hierarchical here means the topics that composes a article are in some kind of hierarchy. It does not represent the topics within an article as a tree.
