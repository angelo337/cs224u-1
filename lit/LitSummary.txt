There are 6 papers.
2014_sematic_analysis.pdf published something to do text classification with wikipedia topics. We may treat this as our previous work.
2006_ESA.pdf and 2007_ESA.pdf are the papers on the method of ESA, which is used to extract topic information from wikipedia. It is used in  2014_sematic_analysis.pdf.
1992_brownCluster.pdf is something like ESA. It is compared with ESA in  2014_sematic_analysis.pdf.
2012_selectiveSearchDraft.pdf is a paper on image object detection. I think we can build a similar object detection method on text.
The last paper is not so useful. But it proposes a way of perciving the relations between labels in a heirarchical category structure.
