James came into the English language from the Old French variation James[1] of the late Latin name Iacomus. This was a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek Ἰάκωβος (Iákōbos), from Hebrew יעקב (Yaʻaqov) (Jacob). The development Iacobus > Iacomus is likely a result of nasalization of the o and assimilation to the following b (i.e., intermediate *Iacombus) followed by simplification of the cluster mb through loss of the b. Diminutives include: Jim, Jimmy, Jimmie, Jamie, Jimbo, and others.
James was the most common male name in the United States in 1990.[2] Likewise, in Northern Ireland, the name has appeared among the 10 most popular for the last quarter of the 20th century and into the 21st.[3]
It is currently the fifth most common name in the United States. 1/32 of all Americans are named James (3.1%).[citation needed]
In 2013, it was the eighth most popular name for boys in Australia.[4]
In England and Wales, James has been one of the Top 20 most commonly-given male names since at least 1954 and in the Top 10 since at least 1974.
